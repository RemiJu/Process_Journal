Keeping Track of my weekly process and thoughts I guess.

# Jan 8 - Jan 14

We were introduced to the class. We introduced ourselves and got an understanding of what we'd be doing through the course of the semester. For next week we need to finish the Tanks! Tutorial. And add additional components if we can.

We started the tutorials after looking at Pippin's games. The idea of coming up with many game concepts interests me, as I am similar but in terms of coming up with short story ideas at fast speeds. Not so much mechanics.

I've been thinking a lot about an interview of Shigeru Miyamoto in which he discussed how they tend to hire non gamers as they tend to come up with more interesting ideas and bring in outside influences as opposed to sticking to established mechanics and simply improving them. This interests me as well though it's a bit late for me as I'd consider myself already a gamer. But maybe I can still think up other things.

On the other hand, after class as I talked a bit with Melina, and Geoff before that, I threw out some ideas, which may have been aided or hampered by a headache I'd been having. But I thought they were interesting at the time. Will have to check again when the headache has died down. But mainly I thought it'd be funny if when a tank was destroyed a soldier would come out and need to be killed also to complete the game.

This led later while I was on the bus, to think about how this mechanic could be expanded like having empty tanks on the environment which would need to be destroyed so that when a pilot exits they can't get a new one and keep fighting. And even further developed into ideas for the main project where the player could exit the tank at will and would need to use the tank for puzzle solving situations of such. A horror like situation where a player must make it through a nightmarish landscape with the help of their tank for combat and visualization as well as general safety from enemies as the soldiers battle capabilities would be limited.

Also been thinking of fairy tales a lot and possible ways to integrate them into this game.

Wonder if I can make the soldier and extra tank version for next week.

# Jan 15 - Jan 21

As we were discussing lights and the TANKS! unity game in general I came up with some ideas about what to play around with. Simple things like adding a sort of day night cycle to the game in which the sun/ light just moves over the area and out to represent the course of day and night, maybe adding lamp objects that turn on at night time.

As continuation to my puzzle ideas from last week I decided it'd be interesting if rather than the tank having a flash light theplayer can only see the environment based on the bullet emission to navigate an area. Or the tank shoots some form of Light rounds that illuminate an area for a while after they explode or remain where they land emmitting light for things like platforming and such. Need to work on the exit and enter tank script for the little soldier I modelled for my unfinished idea. 

In regards to camera I thought mainly of having it change depending on whether the player is in the tank or out. Hard to come up with other ideas, except maybe changing from orthographic to dynamic/regular 3D camera to solve environmental puzzles that otherwise couldn't be solved. Maybe even a First person mode that can be accessed through key press to examine other things. Need to research this further.

In regards to my original idea as well, the scattering of other tanks and having the soldier be the true goal adds to the use of the map which was criticized in class. I have ideas of how to make things work, such as when soldier collides with tank they switch layers. The main issue I have though is how the tank script must be changed for my idea to work as well as the game manager, mainly with things such as having the tank be assigned the controls of the player that enters and not having them interfere with others. As well as already having the tanks be active before being entered.
